# Computer Graphics Basics
![openGL-figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvcarrillo/computer-graphics-basics/master/screenshot.png "Figure and lights with flat shadowing")

**This repo contains works on Computer Graphics using OpenGL and C++.**
It is part of the course of **Informática Gráfica from the BSc in Computer Engineering at the 
University of Granada**, so I expect it to be used as a reference for everyone interested in
this matter, but please avoid copying it. That is also the reason why the program is completely
in Spanish.

## Includes
- Basic figures, like cubes and tetrahedrons
- A PLY reader with some figures in PLY format
- Figures of revolution
- Animations and hierarchical figures
- Lights and materials applied to objects
- Textures in a 2D panel

## How to use it
Just run `make` in the root folder and then `./practica4` to execute it.
The program will show instructions on how to use it.
Make sure that the package `freeglu3-dev` is installed on your machine **before compiling
the program.**
